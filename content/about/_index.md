My name is Scott McKenzie. I'm an engineer for Samsung, where I use **data analytics** to help my team better understand our manufacturing **operation**. During my free time, I enjoy developing open-source tools making it easier to harvest implicit patterns in datasets.

I have over 5 years of experience using tools like R, SQL, Python, MATLAB, and Excel to promote **better decision-making** in areas of math, science, and statistics. As an undergrad, I studied at Texas A&M University, where I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.

Programming has always been part of my life. Growing up, I developed Flash games and built a new website for my school. In college, I used MATLAB to simulate UAV aerodynamics. Today, I continue to channel my passion for coding into **illuminating analytics**.

My hobbies include photography ðŸ“· , camping â›º, & classical musicðŸŽ».
