Welcome to my website! This is where I showcase ideas that have inspired me on my data science journey. 

I originally earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. Several years later, I discovered the wonderful open-source world of&nbsp;R. Together, my industry persective and passion for data science have charted an exciting path - one that I hope to chronicle here.

I am currently an engineer in the semiconductor industry. My job is geared toward helping my team better monitor and understand the behavior of our manufacturing equipment.

This entails:

* Building & testing new Shiny applications that interface with in-house API & AWS S3.

* Constructing data pipelines that efficiently distill millions of rows into concise summaries - mostly in R.

* Applying statistical learning techniques to inline quality data to help characterize equipment performance. This in turn helps us better target which portions of equipment require maintenance.

In my spare time, I enjoy planning long road-trips to the mountains. I am also an avid cellist in the <a href="http://austincivicorchestra.org/">Austin Civic Orchestra</a>.
