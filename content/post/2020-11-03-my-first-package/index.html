<p><strong>meandr</strong> allows for easy generation of coordinates that are random, yet continuously differentiable. This is particularly useful for simulating time-series measurements of physical phenomena that maintain a clear local trajectory.</p>
<p>Essentially, <strong>meandr</strong> provides an alternative to <code>rnorm</code> for noise generation.</p>
<div id="quick-example" class="section level2">
<h2>Quick Example</h2>
<p>You can call <code>meandr()</code> without any arguments! Each call returns a <code>tibble</code> of coordinates.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(meandr)

df &lt;- meandr()

df</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 100 x 2
##         t       f
##     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 0.01   -0.0128
##  2 0.02   -0.0513
##  3 0.03   -0.0897
##  4 0.04   -0.128 
##  5 0.05   -0.167 
##  6 0.06   -0.179 
##  7 0.0700 -0.192 
##  8 0.08   -0.205 
##  9 0.09   -0.192 
## 10 0.10   -0.179 
## # ... with 90 more rows</code></pre>

<p>I also wrote a <a href="https://sccmckenzie.github.io/meandr/articles/case.html">detailed case study</a> about the problem that originally inspired me to create this package.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Altogether, this experience has given me an immense appreciation for how much work goes into package creation. If you’ve never created a package before, I highly suggest two resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">R Packages</a> by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan. This book champions the <strong>usethis</strong> package, which is a must.</li>
<li>Additionally, you might also check out <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html">Chapter 7</a> from Hadley’s Advanced R. This provides thorough explanation of <strong>R Namespaces</strong> - having a deep understanding of this material will make package creation must less daunting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I should give credit to Dave Robinson’s talk, <a href="https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work/">“The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Public Work”</a>. Listening to this talk was one of the most inspirational experiences of my professional life.</p>
<p>No matter where you are in your Data Science journey, sharing your work is one of the most meaningful things you can do for the world.</p>
