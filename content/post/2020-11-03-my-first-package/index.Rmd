**meandr** allows for easy generation of coordinates that are random, yet continuously differentiable. This is particularly useful for simulating time-series measurements of physical phenomena that maintain a clear local trajectory.

Essentially, **meandr** provides an alternative to `rnorm` for noise generation.


```{r echo = FALSE}
set.seed(17)
```


## Quick Example

You can call `meandr()` without any arguments! Each call returns a `tibble` of coordinates.
```{r}
library(meandr)

df <- meandr()

df
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_minimal())

ggplot(df) +
  geom_line(aes(t, f))
```
