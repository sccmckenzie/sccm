<p>You suddenly discover that you are hosting a party tonight. The guests are expecting you to prepare cocktails. With limited time to prepare, you can only make one trip to the store. What ingredients should you buy in order to maximize your mixological palette? Assume your shopping cart holds <code>n</code> items.</p>
<p>In Part 1, we will introduce the <code>cocktails</code> dataset, which forms the inspiration for this problem. Although data cleaning for <code>cocktails</code> is mostly done, some touch-ups are needed. We will apply cosine string distance comparisons to eliminate redundant ingredients.</p>
<p>Part 2 focuses on the approach used to optimize ingredient selection.</p>
<p>Click <a href = "https://sccm.shinyapps.io/cocktail-ingredients/" target = "_blank">here</a> to see the Shiny app that illustrates the final results!</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-26/readme.md"><code>cocktails</code></a> dataset comes from TidyTuesday<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

# Getting data from TidyTuesday repo
cocktails &lt;- read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-26/cocktails.csv&#39;) %&gt;% 
  select(drink, ingredient_number, ingredient, measure) </code></pre>
<p><code>cocktails</code> contains 546 unique drinks. I never considered myself a proper connoisseur by any means, but this dataset serves as a humbling realization that I’ve barely scratched the surface of mixology: Gin Squirt, Godchild, Space Odyssey, to name a few.</p>
<p>The data is structured as shown below. Each ingredient + associated measure is stored in a unique row.
<div id="htmlwidget-1" class="reactable html-widget" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"drink":["Dirty Martini","Dirty Martini","Dirty Martini","Dirty Martini","Dirty Martini"],"ingredient_number":[1,2,3,4,5],"ingredient":["Vodka","Dry Vermouth","Olive Brine","Lemon","Olive"],"measure":["70ml/2fl oz","1 tbsp","2 tbsp","1 wedge","1"]},"columns":[{"accessor":"drink","name":"drink","type":"character","width":125},{"accessor":"ingredient_number","name":"ingredient_number","type":"numeric","width":175},{"accessor":"ingredient","name":"ingredient","type":"character"},{"accessor":"measure","name":"measure","type":"character"}],"defaultPageSize":10,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"dataKey":"d998e56f375a841071bb464b324613d1"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script></p>
<p>The plot below shows the most frequently used ingredients in <code>cocktails</code>. At first glance, there are <span class="math inline">\(333\)</span> distinct ingredients.</p>
<p>Vodka &amp; gin take gold &amp; silver, but I was surprised to see that whiskey doesn’t even make the top 8! Otherwise, the below charts seems to make sense.</p>
<p><br><br>
<img src="/post/2020-06-03-cocktails-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>With just these ingredients, the only drink you’d be able to make to order is a Screwdriver (Vodka + Orange Juice). If you’re trying impress company, this list is not comprehensive enough - your first guest who orders an Old-Fashioned will be disappointed.</p>
<p>Is the solution to simply buy <em>more</em> ingredients? We are assuming that going down the ingredient count list is the smartest method to solve this problem. Spoiler alert: it’s not (more in part 2).</p>
<!-- In order to expand our capability for a wider variety of drinks, we need an effective way to visualize the most common combinations of ingredients. Relying on simple bar plots would quickly become impractical. -->
<!-- I've seen a few examples from other contributors involving network plots[^2] - a great way to visualize the interconnectedness between the 546 drinks. -->
</div>
<div id="the-first-roadblock" class="section level1">
<h1>The First Roadblock</h1>
<p>Skimming through the distinct ingredients, we can observe duplicates due to small differences in capitalization and superfluous adjectives. This could add unwanted redundancy to our selection method and unnecessarily convolute our network plot.</p>
<p>After all, how many different types of lime juice do we need?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cocktails %&gt;% 
  distinct(ingredient) %&gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(ingredient, &quot;(L|l)ime&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9 x 1
##   ingredient        
##   &lt;chr&gt;             
## 1 Lime juice        
## 2 Fresh Lime Juice  
## 3 Lime              
## 4 Lime juice cordial
## 5 Lime Juice        
## 6 Lemon-lime soda   
## 7 Lime vodka        
## 8 Lime peel         
## 9 Limeade</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we can do is force everything to lowercase and remove punctuation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cocktails &lt;- cocktails %&gt;% 
   mutate(ingredient = str_to_lower(ingredient),
         ingredient = str_remove(ingredient, &quot;&#39;&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Although this is a good start, we really need a systematic way to detect similar ingredients. Making <span class="math inline">\(333 ^ 2 /2 = 5.54445\times 10^{4}\)</span> manual comparisons is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Hence, a perfect opportunity to use string distance comparisons. I highly recommend M van der Loo’s paper<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> which provides a thorough introduction to the <a href="https://github.com/markvanderloo/stringdist">stringdist</a> package. We will use the <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/fuzzyjoin/">fuzzyjoin</a> package which harnesses the stringdist tools in a user-friendly interface; but we need to be careful to use a targeted approach.</p>
<p>For example, <code>lime peel</code> and <code>lime juice</code> both contain <code>lime</code> and by many string distance metrics, will be fairly similar. But we certainly don’t want to merge <code>lime juice</code> and <code>lime peel</code> into a single ingredient.</p>
<p>We can perform more meaningful comparisons by first separating the ingredients into categories. This is an excellent opportunity to use the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/tokenizers/">tokenizers</a> package + new <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr 1.0.0</a> functions!</p>
<p>I’m a huge fan of <code>with_groups()</code> since it combines grouping + action + ungroup into one operation, making code chunks more concise.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tokenizers)
with_categories &lt;- cocktails %&gt;% 
  distinct(ingredient) %&gt;% 
  with_groups(ingredient,
              summarise,
              category = tokenize_regex(ingredient,
                                        # essentially word tokenization
                                        pattern = &quot; &quot;,
                                        simplify = TRUE)) %&gt;% 
  add_count(category, name = &quot;freq&quot;) %&gt;% 
  # within each ingredient, what are the most common words?
  with_groups(ingredient, slice_max, 1, order_by = freq) %&gt;%
  with_groups(ingredient, filter, n() == 1) %&gt;% 
  filter(freq &gt; 6)</code></pre>
<p>This results in the below categories.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><div id="htmlwidget-2" class="reactable html-widget" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"category":["juice","liqueur","syrup","cream","rum","vodka","brandy","schnapps","chocolate"],"n":[15,13,11,9,9,8,7,7,5]},"columns":[{"accessor":"category","name":"category","type":"character"},{"accessor":"n","name":"n","type":"numeric"}],"defaultPageSize":10,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"inline":true,"dataKey":"226affb67771fb5f7b0a530c981cba0d"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

We can now apply string distance matching within each category. Consider the juice category as an example. We have the following juices:</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;apple juice&quot;         &quot;cranberry juice&quot;     &quot;fresh lemon juice&quot;  
##  [4] &quot;fresh lime juice&quot;    &quot;fruit juice&quot;         &quot;grape juice&quot;        
##  [7] &quot;grapefruit juice&quot;    &quot;guava juice&quot;         &quot;lemon juice&quot;        
## [10] &quot;lime juice&quot;          &quot;lime juice cordial&quot;  &quot;orange juice&quot;       
## [13] &quot;passion fruit juice&quot; &quot;pineapple juice&quot;     &quot;tomato juice&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We want to evaluate the string distance between each one of these elements. Since these are all juices, we can omit “juice”. Let’s also omit white-space.</p>
<p><div id="htmlwidget-3" class="reactable html-widget" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-3">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"before":["fresh lime juice","apple juice","passion fruit juice","lime juice","fresh lemon juice"],"after":["freshlime","apple","passionfruit","lime","freshlemon"]},"columns":[{"accessor":"before","name":"before","type":"character","width":150},{"accessor":"after","name":"after","type":"character","width":150,"style":{"background":"#2F8475","color":"white"}}],"defaultPageSize":10,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"inline":true,"dataKey":"bfebfc41569cfb55729a3294a4954aad"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

I opted to use q-gram cosine as distance metric, with <span class="math inline">\(q = 1\)</span>. I experimented with edit-based methods, but q-gram seemed to perform best on this dataset.</p>
<p>Suppose we are comparing <code>freshlime</code> and <code>lime</code>. With q-gram cosine, we first construct a set of all possible unique q-length strings (in this case, <span class="math inline">\(length = 1\)</span>) between the two elements, yielding the following set:
<span class="math display">\[set: [f, r, e, s, h, l, i, m]\]</span>
Easy enough. Now, we assign a vector to each element that corresponds to the above set.
<span class="math display">\[v(freshlime) = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\\v(lime) = [0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1]\]</span>
Now, we simply take the dot product of the two vectors and subtract from one.
<span class="math display">\[1 - \frac{2 + 1 + 1 + 1}{\sqrt{11}\sqrt{4}} = 0.246\]</span>
A value of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> indicates an exact match (vectors are identical), whereas a value of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> indicates no q-gram commonality (perpendicular vectors).</p>
<p>A q-gram cosine matrix for a few juices is shown below. <code>freshlime</code> and <code>lime</code> share the lowest value in this set - which is what we intended.</p>

I set the lower string distance threshold to <span class="math inline">\(0.3\)</span> - anything below this value will be held out for review.</p>
